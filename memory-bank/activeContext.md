# Active Context

**Current Goal:** Update API test plan and tasks based on the newly provided OpenAPI v5.0.0 specification.

**Current Mode:** VAN (Completed) -> Transitioning to PLAN.

**Focus Areas:**

- Analyze discrepancies between the old plan/tasks and the new API spec.
- Incorporate new API functional areas (Messages, Favorites, Images, Invoices, Reports, TOTP, Payment) into the test plan.
- Expand existing areas (Users, Products, Categories, Brands, Cart) based on new endpoints/parameters.
- Define new tasks in `tasks.md` for implementation.
- Identify necessary new API helper files (`api/*.ts`) and test spec files (`tests/api/*.spec.ts`).
- Consider role-based access control (Admin vs. User) for relevant endpoints.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Review the proposed updates to `API_TEST_PLAN.md` and `tasks.md`.
2.  Proceed with PLAN mode to detail the implementation strategy for the new tasks.
