# Active Context

**Current Focus:** Initiating the implementation of the API test suite based on the roadmap defined in `API_TEST_PLAN.md`.

**Recent Changes:**

- Established the core project structure (`api/`, `tests/api/`, `utils/`).
- Created `API_TEST_PLAN.md` outlining the phased implementation approach.
- Implemented the initial `AuthAPI` helper class (`api/auth-api.ts`) with a login method.
- Created the initial test file (`tests/api/auth.spec.ts`) with a basic successful login test.
- Initialized the Memory Bank core files (this file and its siblings).

**Next Steps:**

- Verify credentials in `.env` and run the initial `auth.spec.ts` test.
- Expand `auth.spec.ts` with more login scenarios (invalid credentials, other users) as per Phase 1 of the test plan.
- Implement registration functionality (if API supports it) or move to User Profile/Address Management tests within Phase 1.

**Active Decisions:**

- Following the phased approach in `API_TEST_PLAN.md`.
- Adhering to the defined system patterns (API helpers, test separation).
