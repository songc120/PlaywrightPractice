# Active Context

**Current Goal:** Update API test plan and tasks based on the newly provided OpenAPI v5.0.0 specification.

**Current Mode:** VAN

**Focus Areas:**

- Analyze discrepancies between the old plan/tasks and the new API spec.
- Incorporate new API functional areas (Messages, Favorites, Images, Invoices, Reports, TOTP, Payment) into the test plan.
- Expand existing areas (Users, Products, Categories, Brands, Cart) based on new endpoints/parameters.
- Define new tasks in `tasks.md` for implementation.
- Identify necessary new API helper files (`api/*.ts`) and test spec files (`tests/api/*.spec.ts`).
- Consider role-based access control (Admin vs. User) for relevant endpoints.

**Recent Completed Tasks:**

- Fixed `tests/api/categories.spec.ts` by removing dependencies on `testCategoryId` and making test cases self-contained, creating temporary test categories within each test.
- Fixed `api/images-api.ts` and `tests/api/images.spec.ts` by correcting the API request method from using invalid `.get()` to the proper Playwright `fetch()` method with a 'GET' parameter and fixing authorization token usage in the test.

**Next Steps:**

1. Continue implementing tasks based on the roadmap in `tasks.md`.
2. Focus on completing Phase 2: Product, Category & Brand Management tasks.
3. Ensure API helper classes follow consistent patterns with proper TypeDoc documentation.
4. Review remaining API helper classes to ensure they follow the correct Playwright request pattern using `fetch()` instead of directly using HTTP methods.
