# Progress

**What Works:**

- Basic project setup with Playwright/TypeScript is complete.
- Directory structure for API tests (`api/`, `tests/api/`, `utils/`) is established.
- Constants management (`utils/constants.ts`) and environment variable loading (`dotenv`) are configured.
- The initial `AuthAPI` helper class (`api/auth-api.ts`) exists with a basic login method.
- A test file (`tests/api/auth.spec.ts`) exists with a test case for successful admin login.
- `API_TEST_PLAN.md` provides a roadmap for test implementation.
- Memory Bank core files have been initialized.

**What's Left to Build:**

- Implement the remaining test scenarios outlined in `API_TEST_PLAN.md`, starting with Phase 1 (Authentication and User Management).
- Create necessary API helper classes and test files for subsequent phases (Products, Cart, Checkout, Orders, etc.).
- Develop strategies for managing test data setup and teardown effectively.
- Implement comprehensive negative path and security testing (Phase 6).

**Current Status:** Ready to begin expanding the test suite starting with the remaining Phase 1 authentication tests.

**Known Issues:**

- None identified at this time.
