# Product Context

**Problem Solved:** Provides automated validation of the backend functionality of the Practice Software Testing e-commerce platform, ensuring API reliability and correctness separate from the UI.

**How it Works:** The tests interact directly with the API endpoints, simulating user actions (login, add to cart, etc.) and verifying responses and state changes.

**Goals:**

- Increase confidence in API stability during development and deployment.
- Catch regressions in API functionality early.
- Provide fast feedback on backend changes.
