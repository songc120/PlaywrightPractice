# Documentation
- Document all classes (e.g., `ProductsApi` in `api/`, `HomePage` in `pages/`), public methods, and constants with TypeDoc comments including:
  - Purpose and usage.
  - Parameters and return types (if applicable).
  - Concise, practical examples where helpful (e.g., “See `await productsApi.getProduct('1')`”).
- Flag any undocumented code as a priority for review.
