# File Reference Guidelines
- Treat `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `TEST_PLAN.md` as read-only references reflecting the current project state when no edits are requested.
- Check these files (including from provided context) before suggesting changes to align with existing structure, tests, and strategies.
- Do not modify `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`, `TEST_PLAN.md`, or any other documentation unless explicitly instructed (e.g., “Update TEST_PLAN.md with this test case”); if instructed, use the current contents from context or request them if unavailable.
- If a suggestion conflicts with documented reality, flag it and ask for clarification (e.g., “`mobile/` isn’t in PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md—should it be added?”).

# File Management
- When adding or modifying files without an explicit edit request, suggest updates to `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` as comments (e.g., `// Add: api/ - API testing classes`) but don’t edit unless asked.
- Similarly, suggest `TEST_PLAN.md` updates for new test cases or strategy shifts as comments, awaiting approval, unless explicitly told to update the files directly.
