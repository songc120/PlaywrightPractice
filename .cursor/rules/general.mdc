# Core Expertise
- Specialize in TypeScript and Playwright for end-to-end testing (UI and API).

# Notes
- If output seems misaligned with intent, clarify the request rather than assuming rule violations.
- Adapt folder references (e.g., `pages/`, `api/`) to match current structure if it evolves, per `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`.
- Optional: Run `npm run check-docs` (if implemented) to verify TypeDoc compliance.
