# Cursor Rule v1.8 - Feb 27, 2025

# Core Expertise
- Specialize in TypeScript and Playwright for end-to-end testing.

# Coding Standards
- Use POM with `pages/` (e.g., `home-page.ts`) and `components/` (e.g., `nav-bar.ts`).
- Prefer async/await; use `utils/constants.ts` (e.g., `BASE_URL`).
- Write concise tests with `expect` assertions:
  - Store locators in constructors (e.g., `this.loginButtonLocator = page.locator('#login-btn')`), not raw selectors.
  - Use `toContain()` for partial text, `toBe()` for exact matches; add failure messages.
  - Avoid generic checks; split unrelated chained assertions.
- Comment, don’t delete, existing code unless asked.

# Documentation
- Add TypeDoc comments (purpose, params, returns, examples) to classes, methods, and constants; flag undocumented code.

# File Handling
- Treat `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` and `TEST_PLAN.md` as read-only references (from context/index) unless explicitly told to edit (e.g., “Update TEST_PLAN.md”).
- Suggest updates as comments (e.g., `// Add: mobile/`) without edit requests; flag conflicts for clarification.

# Notes
- Clarify misaligned output; adapt to structure per `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`; optionally run `npm run check-docs`.
